# ML_Ensambles_Project

## dependencies:
1. rotation-forest
2. scikit-posthocs

## instructions:
ML_ass4.ipynb runs the project. The first two frames are for running from Google Colab using Google Drive. 

If you run from Colab: Make sure to follow the hierarchies in the second frame, and set is_colab to True. You will have to put the Zip files containing the gcforest, grboost(and ogboost), and the datasets (including the meta-features dataset) in the correct hierarchy in your Google Drive.

If you are running from your pc: Set is_colab to False. Extract the zip fies into the same folder as ML_ass4.ipynb. Make sure the meta-features dataset is also in the same folder.
